This project showcases a basic full stack and fully functional banking system made only by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Front-end), Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL (Back-end).
It allows the user with a platform to manage finances through user registration and login, balance checking, deposits, withdrawals, money transfers, Withdrawal history, Deposit history and transactions history.
